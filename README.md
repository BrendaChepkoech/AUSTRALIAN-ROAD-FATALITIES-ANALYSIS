# AUSTRALIAN-ROAD-FATALITIES-ANALYSIS

According to research, there have been more than 189,000 deaths on Australiaâ€™s roads. Approximately four people die and 90 people are seriously injured each day. The cost of road trauma to the Australian community is tragic and widespread. Our project focuses on analyzing crash fatalities data in Australia according to several factors, including gender, age, state, age group, type of road users, day of the week, and time of the week.

This project focuses on carrying out exploratory data analysis to identify the trends and causes of fatalities in Australian roads.

# CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

From the observations I would recommend that the government should allocate more resources to NSW state for improvements of road networks such as raising modern traffic signs such as speed limit signs, tarmacking and deploying more traffic officers in the roads.

Secondly,the government should enhance strict punitive measures for anyone who overspeeds in NSW roads as it has been accounted for as the major cause of fatalities. NSW drivers should benchmark the drivers in ACT to see what they are doing differently.

All cars should be fitted with airbags for emergency safety to safe drivers in case of car crash. The young people aged 17 -25 should be educated on the importance of road safety as they are the ones prone to the fatalities.
